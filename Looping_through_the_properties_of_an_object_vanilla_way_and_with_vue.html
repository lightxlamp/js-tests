    var txt = "";

<!--Let's try to do the same thing but with a new "knowledge" of Vue XD -->
<!--Sorry for a wrong <script> positioning, but it is more convenient for me to place it here. To divide 2 approaches-->

<h2>Object Properties with Vue</h2>

<div id="demoVue">
    <span v-for="property in person">{{property}} </span>
</div>

<script>
    let vue = new Vue({
        el: '#demoVue',
        data: {
            person: {fname:"John", lname:"Doe", age:25},
            personSting: ''
        }
    })
</script>

<h2>By the way... I've just noticed that loading "vue" part is taking some time.</h2>
<h2>While result of an "old code" displays "instantly". Ask Erick about it XD</h2>
<h2>Or... I hope I will understand (google) it by myself someday...</h2>
<h2>Reproduced by: pressing Command+R constantly</h2>
<h2>7 minutes later... :p</h2>
<h2>My bad. I got it. By checking speed with a local 'vue' library. Now Vue works "instantly" too</h2>

<hr>
<p>"Vue Attribute is not allowed here" - warning was resolved in my WebStorm. Thanks to this lesson</p>
<p>"There is no locally stored library for the HTTP link" - was fixed here as well. But speed of loading was
    not increased by this action</p>
